      "description": "As an architectural engineer by training, and working as a web dev for the past couple of years, Katerina will explain how architecture has defined the way she designs web apps and pages and how Angular has supported her in organising content. A web page for me is like the facade of a house. From day one into web development, I looked at apps as if setting down plans for a new building. The process, like the process of building from the ground an establishment. I want to talk about scaffolding. I want to extend on designing the building blocks, the bricks made out of components. And as the construction is evolving, how materials fill in the empty spaces, making them consistent.",

      "description": "More and more web applications using Angular today need a kind of map, either to just display their location, or visualize their data. These data can be from points/locations of services/places/etc, or a user input, to more complex visuals like heatmaps or paths. These visualizations can easily be achieved with OpenLayers open source library, or even the Google Maps JS API. However, the integration with Angular and the use of its tools is not always straightforward. In this presentation I will show examples of how to integrate OpenLayers and Google Maps easily into your Angular application without the use of any external libraries. Part of the presentation will also show some techniques for visualising spatial data on these maps.",

Tools that are going to be used will be the WebSockets API, Angular, RxJS and a little Node.js server. RxJS and its observable sequences will help us subscribe and listen to our incoming messages, firing events in the process.

      "title": "Angular real time interactions with WebSockets",
      "description": "Using Angular and WebSockets we will be turning physical motion into virtual motion, in order to perform actions in our browser (navigation, event firing, etc). We will see the integration process step-by-step, resulting in a simple web application using WebSockets, Angular and a plain WebSocket client/server node.js server. Once we launch this application on our phone, it will start sending device motion data from our phone to the browser, using the brand new device event APIs to capture our device’s acceleration, orientation and motion, and our node.js server to perform the transmission. The browser will receive the motion data, and it will translate it into events and actions on the big screen! Tools that are going to be used are the WebSockets API, Angular, RxJS and a little Node.js server. Observable sequences will help us subscribe and listen to incoming messages, firing events in the process. The presentation will be interactive (users connected to the same network will be able to send data with their phone, too).",
